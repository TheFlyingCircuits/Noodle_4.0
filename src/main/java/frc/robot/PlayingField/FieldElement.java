public interface FieldElement {
    // Because there are many different things that could be considered an indiviudal field element of
    // interest this year (e.g. reef faces vs individual stalks vs individual branches) I opted to
    // make FieldElement an interface which is then implemented by several similar but distinct classes,
    // rather than having a single FieldElement type like last year.
    // This increases our type safety in functions where we expect to be working with a specific type of field element,
    // and also leaves open the possility for unique methods for each variant/subtype
    // (e.g. asking a ReefFace what branches it has, or asking a Stalk which ReefFace its on).
    //
    // Design Note: I originally wanted to make FieldElement an enum that was extended by other enum subtypes, but such a design isn't possible
    //              in java because each enum implicitly extends an Enum class, and java doesn't support multiple inheritance
    //              (e.g. if ReefFace and FieldElement were enums, then ReefFace couldn't extend FieldElement because ReefFace already extends Enum,
    //                    and java's lack of multiple inheritance means that each class can't extend more than one other class).
    //
    //              This restriction led me to make FieldElement an interface, which was then implemented by all the subtypes (which were still enums themselves).
    //              However, this made it difficult to properly set up the links between faces, stalks, and branches because each set of
    //              enum instances had to be fully constructed before they could be refrenced elsewhere, which led to some unexpected
    //              null pointer issues if you weren't careful with the initialization order:
    //              https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1506410/java-enums-two-enum-types-each-containing-references-to-each-other
    //              https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14850842/overriding-abstract-method-or-using-one-single-method-in-enums
    //              
    //              The interface+enums approach also conflicted a bit with my desire to have FieldElement still
    //              emulate the feel of an enum. In particular, I preferred the simple flat structure of:
    //
    //              FieldElement.PROCESSOR                                     FieldElement.NonReefElement.PROCESSOR
    //              FieldElement.FRONT_LEFT_REEF_FACE                          FieldElement.ReefFace.FRONT_LEFT
    //              FieldElement.STALK_A                     rather than       FieldElement.ReefStalk.A
    //              FieldElement.BRANCH_B4                                     FieldElement.ReefBranch.B4
    //              FieldElement.HANDHELD_TAG                                  FieldElement.MoveableFieldElement.HANDHELD_TAG
    //
    //              While I could've achieved the flat structure by having a reference to each enum instance
    //              directly in FieldElement, that would give two different ways of accesing each field element
    //              (i.e. you could use the left or right approach for any given row above), and I much preferred
    //              the simplicity of only having one way to do things (zen of python and whatnot).
    //
    //              This led to the current structure of a FieldElement interface that holds all the instances
    //              of several implementing classes. While I'm still not super pleased with this approach because
    //              of how spread out the implementation is, and how much enum functionality I have to re-implement
    //              myself (like variable names and a list of all values) it at least offers external users the API
    //              I was going for. Because of that, and for the sake of time, I'm going to leave it like this for now.
    //              I feel like the real solution to this problem is to just use language features that
    //              aren't available in java, like Rust style enums or Go/Typescript style structural typing.
